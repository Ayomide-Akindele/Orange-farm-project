# Instructions

👥 **This is a team project**. You can work with teammates you’ve worked with before, or find new teammates. You should form a team with a maximum of 3 teammates to work on your project. 

Your team will have to agree on a project idea. If you have a firm idea of what you want to build, make sure to tell your partners before you decide to join the team together.

If you cannot or do not wish to work with a teammate, you may work on the project alone. If you have trouble finding a partner, or have trouble with the project, use the #help-web channel in Discord.


## Topic and Design Guidelines

Your team gets to decide what your final project will be. The challenge is to choose a design that is exciting to you, but is not so big that it’s overwhelming or impossible to complete.

Here’s some guidelines that can help you pick an exciting project you’ll be able to complete.

- Your final project should be about as complicated as the most complicated exercises and projects you’ve already done, or maybe a little bit more advanced.
- Don’t plan to learn a whole new technology for the final project. Plan to use mostly what you’ve already learned (with a little bit more Googling for the things you run into along the way).
